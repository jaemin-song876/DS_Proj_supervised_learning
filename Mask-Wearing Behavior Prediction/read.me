# 😷 Mask-Wearing Behavior Prediction Using Survey Data

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to use statistical learning models to predict **how often individuals wear a mask in public settings**, based on their survey responses. This allows us to understand behavioral patterns and psychological factors that influence mask usage.

## 🦠 Background

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since early 2020, the pandemic has affected every locality in the world, leading to multiple waves of infection.

During the initial phase of the outbreak, three major public health recommendations were promoted:

1. Wearing a mask  
2. Washing hands  
3. Practicing social distancing (especially indoors)

Among these, **mask-wearing** became the most discussed and scrutinized topic—especially in the U.S.—due to mixed messages from officials and differing local policies. As a result, **mask-wearing behavior varied across regions and individuals**.

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset is based on a **survey conducted among Texas A&M University students** during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It captures various aspects of mask-wearing behavior, including:

- Perceived benefits and risks  
- Social norms and peer influence  
- Sense of autonomy or external pressure  
- Observations of others’ behavior

### 🔹 Data Format

- **Input variables:** 151 survey questions (each representing a unique behavioral or perceptual item)
- **Output variable:**  
  Mask-wearing frequency categorized into:
  - `Rarely` (includes responses like Never, Rarely, and Sometimes)
  - `Most of the Time`
  - `Always`

- The second row in the data file contains the **full question text** and **answer choices** for each variable.
