# 🏘️ Boston Housing Price Prediction (1970)

## 📄 Project Overview

This project simulates a scenario in 1970 where you are hired as a data consultant for a real estate company in Boston. The objective is to build a regression model that helps the company assess whether a customer’s budget aligns with expected housing prices based on their preferences.

We use the **Boston Housing dataset** from the `ISLP` package, which contains data for 506 suburbs of Boston and 13 predictor variables per area.

The model predicts the **log-transformed median house value** (`log(medv)`) as the response variable.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a predictive model for `log(medv)` using structural, accessibility, and neighborhood-related features.
- Identify key features that influence house prices.
- Use model diagnostics and selection techniques to choose a final model.
- Provide an executive summary for business stakeholders.

## 📦 Data Source

- Dataset: `Boston` (from the [ISLP package](https://islp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/Boston.html))
- Observations: 506 suburbs
- Features: 13 variables including crime rate, room number, distance to employment centers, etc.

## 🔍 Features Considered

The following categories and variables were specifically examined:

### 1. 🏗️ Structural Properties
- `age` – Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- `rm` – Average number of rooms per dwelling
- `zn` – Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots

### 2. 🚗 Accessibility
- `dis` – Weighted distance to five Boston employment centers
- `rad` – Index of accessibility to radial highways

### 3. 🏘️ Neighborhood Characteristics
- `crim` – Per capita crime rate by town
- `chas` – Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- `ptratio` – Pupil–teacher ratio by town

Additional variables were also considered to improve model performance.

---

## 📊 Methodology

- Applied **log transformation** to the target variable (`medv`) for better model fit.
- Explored relationships via pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
- Built multiple linear regression models using `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`.
- Performed feature selection based on AIC, BIC, and adjusted R².
- Validated model with residual analysis and normality checks.

## ✅ Final Model Summary

The final regression model includes key variables from all three categories, offering both interpretability and strong predictive power. See the `report.pdf` for detailed regression output and executive summary.
